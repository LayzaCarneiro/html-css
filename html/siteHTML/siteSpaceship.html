        The rocket has two stages. The first (booster) stage carries the second
        stage and payload to a certain altitude, after which the second stage
        lifts the payload to its ultimate destination. The rocket evolved
        through several versions. V1.0 flew from 2010–2013, V1.1 flew from
        2013–2016, while V1.2 Full Thrust first launched in 2015, encompassing
        the Block 5 Full Thrust variant, flying since May 2018.

        Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle that is
        produced by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer. The rocket
        consists of two strap-on boosters made from Falcon 9 first stages, a
        center core also made from a Falcon 9 first stage, and a second stage on
        top.[8] Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently
        operational launch vehicle and the third-highest capacity of any rocket
        ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V and Energia.

        Falcon Heavy was designed to be able to carry humans into space beyond
        low Earth orbit, although as of February 2018, SpaceX does not intend to
        transport people on Falcon Heavy, nor pursue the human-rating
        certification process to transport NASA astronauts.[12] Both Falcon
        Heavy and Falcon 9 are expected to eventually be superseded by the
        in-development Starship launch system.
