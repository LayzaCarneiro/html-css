      <h3>Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</h3>
      <p>
        Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (doing business as SpaceX) is an
        American spacecraft manufacturer, space launch provider, and a satellite
        communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It
        was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, with the goal of reducing space
        transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. It manufactures
        the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines,
        Cargo Dragon, crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
        SpaceX is developing a satellite internet constellation named Starlink
        to provide commercial internet service. In January 2020, the Starlink
        constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched,
        and as of July 2022 comprises over 2,700 small satellites in orbit.[7]
        The company is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully
        reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital
        spaceflight. It is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle
        once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and
        Dragon fleet. It will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital
        rocket ever built on its debut, scheduled for 2022 pending launch
        license.
      </p>
      <p>
        SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded
        liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit around Earth;[9] the first
        private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft;
        the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International
        Space Station; the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive
        landing for an orbital rocket booster; first reuse of such booster; and
        the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the
        International Space Station. SpaceX has flown and landed the Falcon 9
        series of rockets over one hundred times.
